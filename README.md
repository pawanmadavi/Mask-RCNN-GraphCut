# IMAGE-SEPARATION-BY-MASK-RCNN + GRABCUT Approach 
This code is originally from https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/09/28/image-segmentation-with-mask-r-cnn-grabcut-and-opencv/
we merge mask R-CNN and Grabcut for image segmentation
The neural network was pre-trained on Ms-Coco data

The implementation was carried out on two types of images To know more details, you can follow the entire article on the Artificial Intelligence blog in Arabic at the following link:
